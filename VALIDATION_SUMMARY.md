- **Solution**: Prisma @map() directives properly handle conversion

### ✅ Data Types Alignment
- All UUID fields consistent across API and database
- Timestamp formats standardized (ISO 8601 in API, TIMESTAMP in DB)
- Enum values aligned (appointment status, user roles, notification types)

### ✅ Relationship Integrity
- Foreign key relationships properly defined in database
- API endpoints respect these relationships
- Cascade deletes appropriately configured

### ✅ Security & Permissions
- Role-based access control (student/tutor/admin)
- API endpoints specify required permissions
- Rate limiting and input validation planned
