# Phase 2 Progress Report

**Date:** September 21, 2025

## Overview
This document records all major actions, code changes, and validation steps completed during Phase 2 of the Tutoring Calendar project. The focus of Phase 2 was authentication, registration, and admin tooling for user management.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Authentication System
- Implemented NextAuth.js authentication with credentials provider and Prisma adapter
- Created sign-in, sign-up, and error pages with modern UI and form validation
- Integrated secure password hashing (bcryptjs)
- Verified login and registration flows for both students and tutors

### 2. Registration Flow
- Built `/api/auth/register` endpoint for user registration
- Validated registration with Zod schema (email, password, role, etc.)
- Ensured creation of both User and Student records in the database
- Verified registration via browser and command-line tools

### 3. Database Setup & Validation
- Set up PostgreSQL database (via Docker or local instance)
- Updated `.env.local` and Prisma schema for correct connection
- Ran migrations to create all necessary tables
- Verified database health and connectivity

### 4. Admin Tools
- Created `register-student.sh` for CLI-based student registration
- Created `check-students.sh` for CLI-based student listing and verification
- Built temporary debug scripts to inspect user and student data

### 5. Testing & Debugging
- Validated registration and login for multiple students
- Confirmed database persistence and correct record creation
- Debugged and resolved issues with server startup, environment variables, and database access
- Committed all changes to git with clear commit messages
