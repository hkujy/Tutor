- `title` - Note title/subject
- `content` - Note content/body
- `type` - Note category (GENERAL, SESSION_FEEDBACK, PROGRESS_UPDATE, etc.)
- `priority` - Priority level (LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, URGENT)
- `isPrivate` - Privacy flag (visible to tutors only)
- `tags` - Array of searchable tags
- `sessionDate` - Optional date for session-specific notes

**Priority Levels:**
- LOW - General information
- NORMAL - Standard notes
- HIGH - Important observations
- URGENT - Critical issues requiring attention

### 2. API Endpoints

**GET /api/notes**
- Fetch notes with comprehensive filtering
- Role-based access control
- Support for query parameters:
  - `studentId` - Filter by specific student
  - `tutorId` - Filter by specific tutor
  - `type` - Filter by note type
  - `priority` - Filter by priority level
  - `isPrivate` - Filter by privacy status
  - `limit` - Pagination limit
  - `offset` - Pagination offset

**POST /api/notes**
- Create new student notes (tutors only)
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Automatic notification creation for high/urgent priority notes
- Access control verification (tutor must have taught the student)

**PUT /api/notes**
- Update existing notes (tutors only)
- Ownership verification
- Partial updates supported

**DELETE /api/notes**
- Delete notes (tutors only)
- Ownership verification
- Confirmation required

### 3. User Interface Components

**StudentNotesManager Component:**
- Comprehensive notes management interface
- Real-time filtering and searching
- Create/Edit/Delete functionality
- Tag management system
- Priority indicators with visual cues
- Privacy controls
- Session date tracking
- Responsive design

**Key UI Features:**
- Visual note type indicators with color coding
- Priority indicators with emojis (üö® for urgent, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è for high, etc.)
- Private note indicators (üîí)
- Tag display and management
- Formatted timestamps
- Modal forms for creating/editing notes
- Confirmation dialogs for deletions

### 4. Integration with Dashboards

**Tutor Dashboard Integration:**
- New "Student Notes" tab added

### 5. Security and Access Control

**Role-Based Access:**
- Tutors: Full CRUD access to notes for their students
- Students: Read-only access to non-private notes
- Admin: Full access (inherited from tutor permissions)

**Privacy Controls:**
- Private notes only visible to tutors
- Student access verification through appointment history
- Ownership validation for all operations

**Data Validation:**
- Zod schema validation for all inputs
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma
- XSS protection through React escaping

### 6. Notification Integration

**Automatic Notifications:**
- High and urgent priority notes trigger notifications
- Email notifications sent to students
- Notification includes note title and priority level
- Integration with existing notification system

### 7. Performance Optimizations

**Database Optimizations:**
- Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Relationship loading optimization
- Pagination support for large note sets
- Filtered queries to reduce data transfer

**Frontend Optimizations:**
- Component-level state management
- Lazy loading of note content
- Optimistic UI updates
- Debounced search functionality

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Note (Tutor)
```typescript
{
  studentId: "student-123",
  title: "Excellent Progress in Algebra",
  content: "Student has shown remarkable improvement in solving quadratic equations. Completed all homework assignments this week.",
  type: "PROGRESS_UPDATE",
  priority: "HIGH",
  isPrivate: false,
  tags: ["algebra", "improvement", "homework"],
  sessionDate: "2025-10-15"
}
```

### Filtering Notes
```typescript
// Get all high priority notes for a student
GET /api/notes?studentId=student-123&priority=HIGH

// Get all session feedback notes
GET /api/notes?type=SESSION_FEEDBACK

// Get private notes only
GET /api/notes?isPrivate=true
```

## Testing

**Test Coverage:**
- API endpoint testing with comprehensive scenarios
