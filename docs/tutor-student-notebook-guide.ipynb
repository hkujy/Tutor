    "## 🏆 Best Practices for Effective Note-Taking\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **For Tutors: Writing Effective Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Be Specific and Actionable**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   ❌ Poor: \"Alex did okay today\"\n",
    "   ✅ Good: \"Alex mastered quadratic formula but needs practice with word problems. Completed 8/10 problems correctly. Focus next session on translating word problems to equations.\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Appropriate Note Types**\n",
    "   - **Session Feedback**: For post-lesson summaries\n",
    "   - **Progress Update**: For milestone assessments\n",
    "   - **Achievement**: To celebrate successes\n",
    "   - **Academic Concern**: For areas needing attention\n",
    "   - **Homework Reminder**: For assignments and deadlines\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Privacy Guidelines**\n",
    "   - **Public Notes**: Progress updates, achievements, homework reminders\n",
    "   - **Private Notes**: Behavioral concerns, parent communications, sensitive observations\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Effective Tagging**\n",
    "   - Use consistent tag naming (e.g., \"algebra\", \"geometry\", \"test-prep\")\n",
    "   - Include subject areas, skills, and topics\n",
    "   - Add temporal tags (\"october\", \"midterm\", \"final-prep\")\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Priority Setting**\n",
    "   - **🚨 Urgent**: Immediate safety or academic concerns\n",
    "   - **🟠 High**: Important achievements or issues needing attention\n",
    "   - **🟡 Normal**: Regular session notes and updates\n",
    "   - **🟢 Low**: General observations and minor notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 **For Students: Getting the Most from Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regular Review**\n",
    "   - Check notes weekly to track your progress\n",
    "   - Look for patterns in feedback\n",
    "   - Identify areas for improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Goal Setting**\n",
    "   - Use achievement notes to build confidence\n",
    "   - Set goals based on progress updates\n",
    "   - Track improvement over time\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Communication**\n",
    "   - Ask your tutor about specific feedback\n",
    "   - Request clarification on homework reminders\n",
    "   - Discuss concerns mentioned in notes"
